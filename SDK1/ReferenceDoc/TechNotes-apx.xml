      <title>Tools</title>

      <para>These are some of the tools we have found helpful in implementing
      the INDIface SDK.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Process Monitor</title>

        <para>ProcMon by Sysinternals (a subsidiary of Microsoft) has proven
        valuable to monitoring the reading/writing of files and registry
        entries as an application interacts with IfSearch. Start at <olink

        <title>Network Monitor</title>

        <para>WireShark has proven useful when connecting new IP cameras. Get
        it at <olink

      <section>
        <title>Image Viewing and Manipulation</title>

        <para>IrfanView is a very helpful utility for viewing, manipulating,
        and converting still images and directories of images. Visit <olink
        targetptr="http://www.irfanview.com/">http://www.irfanview.com/</olink>
        if you are interested. Unfortunately it is only available on Windows
        at the moment.</para>

        <title>Screen Capture</title>

        <para>If you don't already have a favorite Print Screen utility, check
        out Gadwin PrintScreen. We have found the free version very capable,
        but the Professional version has more power. Visit them at <olink

        <title>Video File Manipulation</title>

        <para>AVS4YOU (r) has an excellent suite of multimedia and other
        applications. Start by downloading their Video Converter at
        <olink>http://www.avs4you.com/</olink> and see the note on exporting

      <title>How a Frame Becomes a Match</title>

      <subtitle>Sung to the tune of "How a Bill Becomes a Law"</subtitle>

      <para>This note describes in sequence how the INDIface SDK1 control
      parameters are applied at each step.</para>

      <para>The first figure shows how faces are detected from input frames
      and what criteria are used to qualify them for casual matching against
      INDIbase enrollments.</para>

      <title>Multiple Instances</title>

      <para>Since the v1.60 release of the SDK, you have the ability to have
      multiple instances of the SDK running.</para>

      <para>Keep the following guidelines in mind:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>You can now specify the base registry key on the command line
          as <command>%[orgName/]appName</command>. The default is
          <filename>HKCU/Software/EclipseIR/IfSearch</filename>. Only one
          instance of <filename>IfSearch.exe</filename> should be running on a
          given registry base key at a time. If an instance of IfSearch is
          started while another is running, the running instance will
          terminate itself. There is a possibility that two instances could be
          started almost simultaneously and not know the other exists, so you
          should guard against this.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Multiple instances can use different or share enrollment
          FaceBases. If multiple instances are sharing a FaceBase,</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>If multiple instances will be enrolling, they should have
              non-overlapping ranges of PersonKey and FaceKey. [External
              specification of key ranges isn't supported yet, but can be if
              needed.]</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Enrollment from one instance will not be visible in other
              instances until they are restarted. [This restriction can be
              eliminated if it becomes a problem before we switch to SQL-based
              enrollment.]</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The data files and paths are now relative to the application's
          directory, so W:\hatever\INDIface\bin can be added to the system
          PATH and IfSearch.exe can be executed from any current directory
          now.</para>

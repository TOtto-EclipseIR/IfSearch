<font size="5">Addressing the Corruption of Agile</font>
<p><font size="4">Of the many responses to my editorial on the corruption of Agile, two that disagreed stand out. </font><br>

</p><p>My recent editorial on the <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/the-corruption-of-agile/240166698">corruption of Agile</a>
 lamented the religious aspects of Agile and assailed the view held by 
some developers today that without Agile practices, it's not possible to
 write good software. These points clearly touched a sore 
point,&nbsp;for within hours of posting the editorial, I'd received 
several letters thanking me for writing a long overdue piece. The 
comments both on our site and on the popular programming aggregators 
were thoughtful and generally refined points I made. Among the responses
 that disagreed in part or in whole, two noteworthy ones were an <a href="http://powersoftwo.agileinstitute.com/2014/03/an-open-letter-to-editor-in-chief-of-dr.html">open letter from Rob Myers</a> at the Agile Institute and <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/03/28/The-Corruption-of-Agile.html">a lengthy blog post by "Uncle Bob" Martin</a>, one of the leading exponents of Agile practices, who more directly took me to task. </p>
<p>Myers agreed with my overarching points about Agile, but disagreed 
with my use of TDD as an example of the wayward religious aspects. He 
felt that the enthusiasm for TDD is due to the benefits people derive 
from its use. Specifically, the ability to try out code and, from the 
tests, tell whether it works correctly with the larger code base. And, 
as he insightfully points out, given the ascending complexity of today's
 apps, not many practices enable such quick feedback. He also likes 
tests' ability to be "comprehensive, executable engineering 
documentation describing all the discrete behaviors of the system in a 
non-combinatorial fashion," plus "the ability to change the code rapidly
 and confidently." I have no difficulty with any of Myers' points, save 
the implication that you need TDD to do this. All the benefits he lists 
could be attained equally by writing tests after the code, rather than 
before. And nothing requires that code be written in the smallest 
testable increments — a foundational tenet of TDD. Fundamentally, he's 
praising the benefits of writing many unit tests. I agree with the 
perspective. But TDD is definitely not required to do this.</p>
<p>Bob Martin took on my contention that Agile is a set of values, not a
 set of practices. He repeatedly explained how all cultures, including 
Agile, are known through their practices ("If you see a bride and groom 
breaking glass under a canopy, you can guess the culture.") He extended 
this analogy to other religions and to martial arts, each time 
expressing how the practices define the culture. I don't find this 
argument persuasive.</p>
<p>Many, many practices are so disassociated from the values they 
originally expressed that they have become hollow, empty, ritualistic 
behaviors. Religions, corporations, and Agile shops are just some of the
 institutions that engage in practices despite having long ago lost the 
understanding of the values they were intended to instantiate. </p>
<p>As I pointed out in the original article, organizations that don't 
use the defined Agile practices can still be Agile if they welcome 
change and exhibit the values expressed in the manifesto. I thought 
Martin might run with this and talk about the need to remind 
organizations of those values, to make them living once again. But 
instead, Martin argues that Agile should have <em>more practices</em>: 
"The biggest problem I have seen within the Agile movement is the 
elimination of the practices. One by one, over the years, the practices 
have been de-emphasized, or even stripped away. This loss of practice 
has diluted and changed the Agile culture into something that I don't 
recognize as Agile anymore." </p>
<p>I find this view untenable. The reason many of these practices have 
been abandoned is because they did not generate sufficient lift for the 
cost they imposed. Pair programming being perhaps the defining example 
of this perceived lack of ROI. &nbsp;In response to Martin's post, this 
comment was posted on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/21m3rl/the_true_corruption_of_agile/cgenayz">Reddit</a>:
 "I work at Google. Most teams don't use Agile. A very few do, and the 
team members complain about all the time wasted in 6-hour planning 
sessions. Google has great software engineering discipline, with a huge 
focus on design reviews, code reviews, and strong unit testing and 
integration testing. Most people there recognize that Agile is just a 
religion." It was one of many comments on Reddit to express similar 
dissatisfaction with Agile "religion."</p>
<p>Martin concludes his essay saying, "If you've got better practices, 
I'd love to see them. If I believe they are better, I'll adopt them in a
 heartbeat." However, he does not appear to see the link between the two
 points he's made. He cannot both state that he's willing to abandon 
Agile practices for better ones, and then begrudge the many 
organizations that have done just that.</p>
<p>It may well be that Agile has reached its high-water mark and the 
appreciation of its benefits has begun to recede. If so, Agile itself 
will need agility to adapt to changes. I believe those changes will mean
 that a few core practices will remain and new ones will be adopted as 
the needs of software development dictate. For this to occur 
productively, the values of Agile will need to be retained, while the 
practices change. If you look at Agile being a set of values, this is 
entirely possible, and likely the only way it can move forward.</p>

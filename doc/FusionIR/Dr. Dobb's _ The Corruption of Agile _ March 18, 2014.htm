<font size="5">The Corruption of Agile</font>
<p><font size="4">What was intended as a set of personal practices has 
become a doctrine. And despite the mainstream adoption of Agile, the 
loss of its original intent has undermined its effectiveness. </font><br>

</p><p>Many people over the years have discussed their distress with the
 religious tone that cloaks the implementation of Agile practices. 
Particularly from the testing side of the world, there is a lot of 
"should," "should not," and "can do better next time" dialogue that 
sounds more like a man trying to fix ethical lapses than a developer 
writing code. When I speak with adherents of test-driven development 
(TDD) in particular, there is a seeming non-comprehension that truly 
excellent, reliable code was ever developed prior to the advent of this 
one practice. I sense their view that the long history of code that put 
man on the moon, ran phone switches, airline reservation systems, and 
electric grids was all the result of luck or unique talents, rather than
 the a function of careful discipline and development rigor.</p>
<p>The disconnect between today's Agile view and earlier reality is 
equally evident in the wanton bashing of the waterfall model. To get any
 programmer today to adopt your recommendation, simply state that not 
doing so is just a new way of doing waterfall. Watch his toes curl 
despite  never having used waterfall, nor seemingly having any awareness
 that it served the industry really well for decades. What, was everyone
 in that bygone era a fool? </p>
<p>Alan Kay was entirely right when he said that <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/interview-with-alan-kay/240003442">programming today has become a pop culture</a>:
 "Pop culture is all about identity and feeling like you're 
participating. It has nothing to do with cooperation, the past or the 
future — it's living in the present. I think the same is true of most 
people who write code for money. They have no idea where [their culture 
came from] — and the Internet was done so well that most people think of
 it as a natural resource like the Pacific Ocean, rather than something 
that was man-made. When was the last time a technology with a scale like
 that was so error-free?"</p>
<p>It will pain some readers to know that the vast, error-free Internet predates Agile and even predates TDD. Crazy, right? </p>
<p>What I'm saying here is certainly not new. The fascination with 
today's way of doing things and the view that it is the one true path to
 good code is a seemingly permanent part of the programming culture. But
 it has been greatly abetted by the legions of Agile consultants. By 
stressing the practices, they have corrupted what Agile was about. It's 
important to remember that the Agile manifesto stated values, not 
practices. Immediately, though, values were translated into programming 
practices by consultants and, quickly, the former was lost. One of the 
original formulators of the manifesto, Dave Thomas, whom I interviewed 
this week, states his realization that a month after the manifesto was 
written it was <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/dave-thomas-interview-the-corruption-of/240166688?pgno=2">already being corrupted</a>:
 "…it got immediately productized in many different ways. The whole 
point, to my mind, of the Agile Manifesto is that it's a set of personal
 practices that may scale to team level. You do not need a consultant to
 show you how to do that. It may help to have someone facilitate, but 
you do not need a consultant. And yet immediately what happened was that
 everyone and their dog hung out an Agile shingle and the whole thing 
turned into a branding exercise."</p>
<p>What's interesting in Thomas's account is the view that Agile was a <em>personal</em> practice. Implicit is a personal way of orienting oneself towards a development process that accepts, even welcomes, change. </p>
<p>By pure coincidence, Allen Holub has been driving this point home in several blog posts, the <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/the-agile-holocracy/240166629">most recent of which</a>
 is a brilliant little piece that reminds us that Agile is a culture, 
not a set of practices. As he has previously explained, just because an 
organization is using scrum, doesn't mean it's Agile. He could have said
 the same thing about TDD, continuous integration, pair programming, or 
the like. </p>
<p>Whether a site is Agile or not depends on its culture. Does the 
culture support the personal values of the manifesto? If so, it's Agile,
 if not, then it's doing something else. So, indeed you could have a 
fully Agile site without TDD, continuous integration, or scrum. 
Likewise, you can have a site that uses all three practices, but cannot 
adapt to changes and is wholly inflexible in its work — so, not at all 
Agile. Yeah, I know, crazy, right?</p>

I'm sure there are consultants with this attitude out there, but you'll find just as many or more that find it easier to live by rules. :\\\u003c/p>","isSpam":false,"isHighlighted":false,"points":0},{"isFlagged":false,"forum":"drdobbs","parent":null,"author":{"username":"ubm_techweb_disqus_sso_-ac61112fa323d12304a298045f8ba638","about":"","name":"RadiumCRM","url":"","isAnonymous":false,"rep":1.232124,"profileUrl":"http://disqus.com/ubm_techweb_disqus_sso_-ac61112fa323d12304a298045f8ba638/","reputation":1.232124,"location":"","isPrivate":false,"isPrimary":true,"joinedAt":"2014-03-19T21:25:28","id":"99465578","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/ubm_techweb_disqus_sso_-ac61112fa323d12304a298045f8ba638.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1396332298/images/noavatar32.png"},"isCustom":false,"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/ubm_techweb_disqus_sso_-ac61112fa323d12304a298045f8ba638.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1396332298/images/noavatar92.png","large":{"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/ubm_techweb_disqus_sso_-ac61112fa323d12304a298045f8ba638.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1396332298/images/noavatar92.png"}}},"media":[{"forum":"drdobbs","thumbnailUrl":"//a.disquscdn.com/get?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.radiumcrm.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Fthe-bootstrap%2Fimg%2Fimages%2Fradium_landing.png&key=HDNC07h8KA_x0OcmzA-JMg","description":"RadiumCRM is the business component to Gmail.

From \u201cAll in your head\u201d to \"fast feedback.\"\n\nPre-TDD, I spent a lot more time running various branches and permutations through my mind, or in a flowchart, or in a sequence diagram, and in review with others on my team.

We\u2019ve long had compilers to provide a red flag when I make a syntactic mistake, and now fast tests provide similar near-instantaneous feedback when I \nmistakenly change run-time behavior.  To me, TDD feels like a natural progression of good practices for the computer scientist, and the professional developer.\n\n\n2. From slow and expensive to fast and cheap.\n\nThe code I was building pre-TDD was probably a little more complex than Internet protocols, but not much. We did supercomputer protocol stacks for a variety of machines, some of them with 36-bit words and 9-bit \nbytes. Two modes: Character and binary, but character was also subdivided into translations between any two of ASCII, EBCDIC, and BSD.  Oh, how I would have loved a (really fast) implementation of something \nlike Strategy or maybe there\u2019s even a Bridge hiding in there?\n\nNowadays I find our products to be, in the aggregate, far more complex than in the 80\u2019s: Voice-recognition, search, security, multi-platform, interesting business rules regarding financial transactions, regional \nlaws, internationalization\u2026  Far too much changing (or potentially changing) far too quickly for us to do more than paint broad-stroke architectures at the high level; and far too complex and dynamic for our developers to be doing code-and-fix-and-update-the-UML.-that-no-one-reads.\n\nOverall, TDD now feels far more natural to me.

<p>I agree that agile's corrupted, but not because practices trumped 
culture. It's because the underlying principle behind all the practices 
is so often missed in the application of the practices. It's Empirical 
Process Control (fast feedback). This is well worth the 50 minutes. <a href="http://confreaks.com/videos/282-lsrc2010-real-software-engineering" rel="nofollow">http://confreaks.com/videos/28...</a></p>

<p>I worked with a group in Seattle for a while, who did some modeling to see what was really going on in our "agile" shop.<br>It
 turns out, mathematically speaking, the shorter the hysteresis on the 
iteration cycle was, the cleaner the design ended up. So, in short, EPC 
(as rmerrill53701 mentions) is a fairly reasonable model.</p>

<p>There were other findings as well. Someday I'll have to compile this stuff and put together a paper on it...</p>

<p>I worked at a mid-size software company in the early nineties. The 
company had just adopted the TQM (Total Quality Management) philosophy. 
It became a religion. It got to the point where every decision, no 
matter how small or how simple, required a committee. This slowed down 
the pace of decision making and resulted in "analysis paralysis". By the
 time I left, 5 years later, management had finally backed off and begun
 to give people the freedom to do what made the most sense, whether or 
not it strictly adhered to the TQM philosophy.</p>

<p>No, I don't recall that being the case. Agile was driven by the 
problem that software took so long to deliver that the customer needed 
different features by the time it was delivered. It sought to address 
that by involving the customer/user at all points in the process, 
accepting change as part of the process, and attempting to shorten 
development cycles.</p>

<p>It's not so much that the users requirements changed, although this 
did happen, but it's mostly that the users better understood their own 
requirements after having used the new software for a while. Getting the
 software to exactly match the needs of the user is a painstaking, 
detail-oriented task. Most users, or I should say, most people aren't 
really good of coming up with all the details at the very beginning. </p>

<p>I prefer to do what I will call "Model-Driven Design" where one tries
 to get as much detail as possible during requirements gathering, that 
is, a best first-cut. Where Agile (real Agile) comes into play is in 
prioritizing those requirements and building the software in such a way 
as to be able to deliver the highest-priority functions/features as 
quickly as possible so the one can get feedback from the users sooner, 
rather than later. To do this, one must implement the software in such a
 way so as to maximize "changeability" and "maintainability" through 
"best practices". I will leave it up to the reader to determine what the
 quoted terms actually mean and how "Agile Practices" support them.</p>

<p>This is an issue with human nature. You always have a significant 
portion of the population that finds it easier to live by rules than by 
principles. We see it across every facet of human life, whether it's in 
the workplace, in the family, in politics, in religion ... wherever. 
It's easier to not think.</p>

<p>The flipside is that all of these wonderful constructs of the past 
were more often than not products of real computer scientists and 
mathematicians. People who think. In my experience in the past 15 years,
 I've seen fewer programmers that understand the craft at that level. I 
believe that's a result of the "pop culture" surrounding programming 
that you mention as well as the education industry catering to this 
influx of aspiring "pop" programmers. And you'll always find 
"consultants" looking to make a quick buck by applying a process to fix 
your business ailments, in this case, the ability of your staff to live 
by the culture of agile development.</p>

<p>How do we combat this in a practical way? Raise our hiring standards 
and our salaries? Some do. We can also use processes like 
TDD/BDD/{insert your agile process here} to help teach coders that kind 
of thinking ability and hopefully culture. As an entity in themselves, 
these processes shouldn't be a rule to be considered Agile, but they're 
not evil either. They should be a tool to accomplish your purpose. If 
I'm given an inexperienced/insufficiently trained dev team, I will use 
processes like these and whatever else I have at my disposal to teach 
the appropriate level of awareness, ability and accountability. I'm sure
 there are consultants with this attitude out there, but you'll find 
just as many or more that find it easier to live by rules. :\</p>

<p>I think Agile has good intentions but its not right for every 
situation. Agile and the other philosophies help give order to the chaos
 and for a large team that can be crucial, but for startups I would 
argue not to fool with TDD and some of the other best practices.  You 
don't know what the end product is going to look like and what good is a
 well structured system if there's no market for it?  I wouldn't 
completely hack something together but get a prototype, release it, and 
use the feedback (and hopefully money) you get to restructure it 
properly after.  If the startup busts at least you will fail quicker.</p>

<p>I am a very strong promoter of TDD, and it has sometimes been 
suggested to me that I have a 'religious' view of it. I don't have the 
habit of thinking rigidly so I try to reflect on this, but I really do 
find it hard to think of arguments for not doing TDD. I have seen 
systems written without TDD which have been very effective in meeting 
user needs, but I have seen for example that over time the design gains 
more and more 'momentum' and developers become (justifiably) scared of 
making very necessary adaptions to the design, because they are not sure
 what side-effects there will be.<br>But I am genuinely interested to 
hear counter-arguments regarding how the types of systems mentioned in 
the article (airline reservation systems, electric grid systems etc) 
handled this.</p>

<p>@Neil14 Thanks for your note. My complaint is not with TDD itself, 
but with TDD touted as the only way to write good software. Software 
engineering, which puts real metrics around s/w dev, states the 
effectiveness of TDD is on a par with static code checking and 
significantly behind code reviews. So a good question is: if you're 
spending time doing TDD but not doing more-effective practices, what is 
the gain? The gain touted by TDD exponents is almost invariably in 
comparison with teams that do little or no design and testing. And 
indeed TDD is way better than that nothing at all. But is it the 
end-all? No. It's simply one of many techniques that improves quality.</p>

<p>Thanks Andrew. Of course there is nothing mutually exclusive about 
the quality measures you have mentioned, and I especially promote code 
reviews as well as TDD.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the question is not whether TDD is the 'end-all' 
of quality measures, but whether there is a compelling case to do it, 
which I think there is. This does not preclude there being a compelling 
case to do other things as well, e.g. code reviews.</p>

<p>As an example of a 'compelling case', see the 'design momentum' 
problem referred to in my original post; I cannot see how this can be 
adequately addressed by any other quality measures that I know of. But I
 invite people to correct me on this 'religious' view :-)</p>

<p>As an aside, why am I not as vocal about code reviews as about TDD? 
Because I don't need to be; the compelling case for code reviews is so 
widely accepted.</p>

<p>Mostly agree. TDD has become too popular. Much better than TDD is 
Design by Contract, DbC, which has all the desirable aspects of TDD, but
 marries it with the rigour of formal design as well.</p>

<p>DbC also suits the non-waterfall way of doing things. It is always a 
matter of getting the correct balance of forethought and design and then
 experimental - try something out - to prove a concept.</p>

<p>So does anyone actually use waterfall? - I doubt it. Software 
development is significantly different to hardware engineering. There is
 more scope for feedback loops back into earlier design processes in 
software. Such feedback loops are denied by waterfall.</p>

<p>I think that the pre-agile methodologies like structured design came 
with an immense amount of religious tone. Agile at least has done a lot 
to break down the myths of many previous 'formal' techniques and the 
flurry of silly diagram drawing (yes UML) that has gone on.</p>

<p>Excellent points. TDD is a poor substitute for contract based 
programming, when those contracts can be proven mathematically before 
program execution. TDD, like any automated tests, usually tests a tiny 
fraction of the possible machine state space. </p>

<p>I have never seen anyone use waterfall either, in 30 years as a 
professional, although I heard about its use in government contracts. 
Iterative development methods were popular long before the agile 
buzzword came along.</p>

<p>What I think this article misses is the waterfall and agile method 
didn't start with software.  Waterfall is from manufacturing, where 
design and fabrication are expensive. At each phase you have to sign off
 and pass it over the wall, so that the next group can take their time 
and do their part right.  By the time you get the first run of the 
device manufactured, you have no choice but to sell it and you get to 
incorporate customer feedback in the next iteration.</p>

<p>It isn't the case that car companies thought waterfall was great.  
They wanted iteration, and practiced iteration, but iteration was 
expensive.  The first agile method was probably Kaizen [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K...</a>],
 an initiative by Toyota that brought small improvements in every 
manufacturing run of a car.  In software agile practices are just the 
natural evolution Kaizen and lean manufacturing practices.</p>

<p>Regarding test driven development... Sorry guys, we didn't invent 
that either. If you visit a plant at Ford, you'll see that every part 
they manufacture is tested in isolation.  Usually static and fatigue 
testing that verify that the part is within spec.  These tests run all 
the time on a random sampling of parts both internally manufactured and 
from 3rd parties... What is TDD, if not an evolution of parts testing on
 the manufacturing side.</p>

<p>I guess my point is that Human knowledge is a continuum.  Long gone 
are the days where we come up with things that no one has every thought 
of.  Agile and TDD are a natural evolution of the lean manufacturing 
processes from Mechanical Engineering, a discipline that predates 
software.  Interestingly as 3D printing is dropping in price, Mechanical
 Engineering is becoming more iterative as well.  Parts being prototyped
 earlier, and design iterating as a reaction to customer feedback.</p>

<p>I suppose its true that you can still make a car or a piece of 
software using Waterfall and no testing.. but that is no longer the best
 practice.</p>

<p>I once was at a two-hour demonstration of TDD.  The demonstrator used
 TDD on a small program, with none of the things I constantly run into 
that make testing difficult.  Granted that demonstration is a lot slower
 than doing, we saw slow development of crap code for a system so simple
 I'd have slapped it together, and verified correctness, in far less 
time (and my code would have been of higher quality).  While I like 
automatic tests, one current project is GUI commands for something that 
should display right on the screen and work well when translated into 
CNC machine instructions and run on the mill.   I really don't know how 
to automatically test for any of that, and nobody's ever showed me how.</p>

<p>With that experience, I look at people who say they always use TDD, 
and wonder.  Obviously they're getting something out of it, but based on
 my experience I don't know what.  Are they working on relatively simple
 problems, and really aren't thinking about more complicated one?  Do 
they know things I have no idea about on how to test things (and would 
absolutely love to learn)?  Are they inferior programmers who need a 
crutch that slows them down (which I don't believe in the slightest)?  I
 don't understand, and it bugs me.</p>

<p>People need to make a value judgement as to what needs to be tested 
and what doesn't.  Personally I don't like to automate UI testing, 
because the time isn't worth it.  With Low level components, I like to 
have unit tests that test correctness and performance.</p>

<p>There should also be a distinction between the "Integration tests" 
that might be some sort of manual/semi automatic validation, and "Unit 
tests" that should run all the time.  For your CNC example, or UI code, I
 feel a manual test run when/if the code changes is probably sufficient.
  </p>

<p>Another way to think about it is in regards to how long something may
 take to debug.  A GUI error should be self evident, but a minute 
calculation error may go unnoticed or be hard to track down.  Unit tests
 help get you a foundation where you know everything below here is 
sound.</p>

<p>Being a TDD Zealot isn't useful, but when used pragmatically its very useful.</p>

<p>Why does Agile have to begin and end with the Agile Manifesto? Sure, 
it may have originally promoted only a set of personal practices, but 
those are meaningless if the team you're on, or the organization you're 
in, force you towards something else. The near-religious fervor of 
practitioners comes from that need to push back, and push back hard, if 
they agree with the principles and want to adopt them. You're right that
 it's a culture and not a set of practices, and changing company culture
 is incredibly difficult. You can't expect an average developer to know 
how to approach that, hence the rise of consulting. Agile isn't 
corrupted because companies aren't "doing it right;" maybe they just 
need a little more than 68 words to get going.</p>

<p>Hello Mr. Binstock,</p>

<p>I agree with your conclusions regarding the  productization of Agile,
 and the zealotry regarding various sets of practices.  Within every 
community or body of knowledge, it seems, strong practices become the 
dogma of the enthusiastic, and then the core value gets lost in 
illogical debates where everyone is trying to be “right."</p>

<p>I’d like to take a moment of your time to provide some of my 
experience with the practice that you selected (likely not arbitrarily) 
as an example of the zealotry: Test-Driven Development (TDD). Indeed, 
there is a lot of confusion and passion and zealotry regarding this 
practice.  I feel no need to defend, exactly, but I believe I understand
 much of the enthusiasm, and much of why most people can’t really 
articulate their love for TDD.  One reason why it’s so confusing even 
for those passionately in favor of TDD is that the real value appears as
 a “sub-practice” of TDD. (I’ll come back to that.)</p>

<p>I’ve been writing code since 1976, and in the “Agile” space since 
1998, when I first experienced TDD (or “test-first” as it was known 
then).  Unlike many of my bright-eyed young Agile colleagues, I spent 
half my career crafting quality, nearly-defect-free code before that 
point, without TDD.  Here’s what I’ve noticed over time:</p>

<p>1. From “All in your head” to "fast feedback."</p>

<p>Pre-TDD, I spent a lot more time running various branches and 
permutations through my mind, or in a flowchart, or in a sequence 
diagram, and in review with others on my team.  All great practices, and
 necessary in <br>the days when it took an hour to compile the code.</p>

<p>What I do with test-first coding is describe the outcomes of small 
pieces of behavior in my code, then allow those passing tests to provide
 confirmation of my investment in that behavior.  I no longer have to 
keep the permutations and possibilities in my head.  Great burden 
lifted.  We’ve long had compilers to provide a red flag when I make a 
syntactic mistake, and now fast tests provide similar near-instantaneous
 feedback when I <br>mistakenly change run-time behavior.  To me, TDD 
feels like a natural progression of good practices for the computer 
scientist, and the professional developer.</p>

<p>2. From slow and expensive to fast and cheap.</p>

<p>The code I was building pre-TDD was probably a little more complex 
than Internet protocols, but not much. We did supercomputer protocol 
stacks for a variety of machines, some of them with 36-bit words and 
9-bit <br>bytes. Two modes: Character and binary, but character was also
 subdivided into translations between any two of ASCII, EBCDIC, and BSD.
  Oh, how I would have loved a (really fast) implementation of something
 <br>like Strategy or maybe there’s even a Bridge hiding in there?</p>

<p>Nowadays I find our products to be, in the aggregate, far more 
complex than in the 80’s: Voice-recognition, search, security, 
multi-platform, interesting business rules regarding financial 
transactions, regional <br>laws, internationalization…  Far too much 
changing (or potentially changing) far too quickly for us to do more 
than paint broad-stroke architectures at the high level; and far too 
complex and dynamic for our developers to be doing 
code-and-fix-and-update-the-UML.-that-no-one-reads.</p>

<p>Overall, TDD now feels far more natural to me.  I play a game with my
 code:  “You can’t do this yet,” I say. My code replies “You’re right, I
 fail at that.” I then tell my code how to do that, and together we 
confirm that <br>it works, and simultaneously confirm that I haven’t 
broken anything my code has learned over the years. Then I see if the 
introduction of that implementation is asking to be blended more cleanly
 into the code: <br>Refactoring is the oft-neglected sub-practice of 
TDD. Each time I reshape the design to accommodate this new behavior or 
the next, I run the tests to let my code confirm that it hasn’t lost any
 capability.</p>

<p>In fact, “relentless refactoring,” i.e., the constant application of 
good design practices, is the real “must have” for Agile software 
development. How else adapt to fresh new unexpected requirements without
 being able to reshape code? But without some form of fast, automated, 
deterministic safety-net of tests, relentless refactoring is mere 
dangerous unprofessional hacking. Ergo, test-first coding.</p>

<p>I’m not attached to TDD or even “Agile" as static, dogmatic sets of 
practices for the very reason that I already know it was once less 
efficient than pure human brain-power. Someday we will look back and 
laugh at our zeal. But I think TDD has some good life left to it, <br>because
 of the outcomes:  Comprehensive, executable engineering documentation 
describing all the discrete behaviors of the system in a 
non-combinatorial fashion; and the ability to change the code rapidly 
and confidently.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and kind consideration.</p>

<p>Rob Myers</p>

<p>I don't care what methodology you use (if any), management always 
seems to seize on the fad of the day to disconnect their brains and 
think the process will guarantee results. The promise of "Faster, 
Better, Cheaper" without the need to understand, drives the adoption of 
whatever methodology seems to give them "on time and under budget" will 
win the day.</p>

<p>Some really good feedback here! The fact is that we now have many 
good tools at our disposal and it becomes a matter of selecting the 
right combination for the project at hand. Some people don't like UML 
but there's one diagram type I happen to like: use cases. Use cases can 
be translated to test cases to permit automated testing. There are even 
automated tools for testing at the GUI layer. It's not strict TDD but 
use of the tools by developers can validate the correctness of their 
code or any modifications well before it get to QA.<br>My overarching 
goal is productivity with few or no defects. I believe that the 
investment of some time up-front to build an appropriate development 
environment can pay dividends in the longer term. And it needn't mean 
strict adherence to any "published" model. I like the agile approach 
since it reduces time spent going down the wrong road. But it also, in 
my opinion, depends on good object oriented analysis and design, 
especially if you're working with a language like Java.</p>

<p>How confusing! Dave<br>Thomas promoted agile methods for years, and now it looks like he wants to<br>dissociate himself from the whole idea. I would have expected words like this<br>from Bertrand Meyer, not from the team of Dr.Dobbs. Let’s see what he has to say in his<br>upcoming book on the topic "Agile!

<p>Yes, quite interesting Dave Thomas's comments. Just because you value
 A over B, does not make B entirely irrelevant. I tell my students about
 Essentials and Accidentals. The essentials you must do, but accidentals
 are support activities which are also very relevant. These a terms used
 to characterise entities in philosophy, but are not new to computing - 
Fred Brooks writes about them in Mythical Man Month.</p>

<p>You can also use the ideas of essentials and accidentals in OO 
design. Essentials are the invariant characteristic of objects which 
define their class. Accidentals are the changeable values between 
objects which you model in the attribute state.</p>

<p>Yes, I think some of the folks in the Agile community get a bit 
dogmatic..  BUT..  as someone who is a big advocate of TDD, but has 
plenty of experience coding without it in the past, I think it's a 
little harsh to say that those of us who advocate TDD believe it is not 
possible to write code without it.   I just believe it's better than 
what we had in the past.</p>

<p>The question shouldn't be, can you write good code without TDD, but 
whether TDD brings value over not using it.   If it brings value, and 
few would argue that it doesn't, what is the argument for not practicing
 it?</p>

<p>If you're happy with TDD, by all means, use it. But viewing it as the
 *only* way to achieve various quality measures is where I turn off. And
 that is most definitely a perspective found in TDD. To wit, Humble 
&amp; Farley's otherwise excellent book on Continuous Delivery: "In our 
experience, the only way to get excellent unit tests coverage is through
 TDD." Were I so inclined I could track down many other instances of the
 same views on TDD, both as to testing and quality in general. </p>

<p>Re your final question: the only argument against it is whether TDD 
is the best way to use the considerable time spent writing unit tests. 
BDD and ATDD are alternatives, for example, that might well be better. 
We don't know. So in the absence of data, it's hard to say unequivocally
 that TDD is the best way forward. </p>

<p>Software engineering quantifies the value of various practices in 
software dev and TDD generally comes out as a net +, but it's certainly 
not ahead of code reviews in terms of catching errors. So, if doing TDD 
takes you away from doing code reviews, then, yes it might be costing 
you in the sense that you're not getting the most amount of benefit from
 your time. </p>

<p>I'll be exploring this line in a future set of editorials.</p>
